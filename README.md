### Hey! I'm JRuss! 👋

I've been learning Swift since 2023 and it's been a blast so far! And after years in the B2B Product Management space, I've taken up an incredible opportunity to go full-time software engineering as an iOS developer in August, 2024.

📱 Current Apps:
- 🪐 [StarStream: Icebreaker Questions](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/starstream/id1671658258) is my first app on the app store! It makes social interactions a breeze through fun, hand crafted icebreaker questions.
- More coming soon!
