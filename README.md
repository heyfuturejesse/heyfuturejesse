### Hey! I'm JRuss! ðŸ‘‹

I've been learning Swift this year and it's been a blast!
I've somehow released an app! You can see it here: https://apps.apple.com/au/app/starstream/id1671658258

I'm currently learning Core Data by building a little personal CRM app. It's fun!

I'm also a Product Manager at a B2B Start-up and the author behind a blog, Likely Story!

I'm always down to catch up and chat! You can reach me via the social sites below.
