### Hey! I'm JRuss! üëã

I've been learning Swift since 2023 and it's been a blast! I try and learn something new everyday. ‚ò∫Ô∏è

I also managed to cobble together an app on iOS!

My day job is a B2B Product Manager. I am also the author behind the blog, [Likely Story](https://www.likelystory.me) where I document learnings on Product Management and Agile from time to time.

I'm always down to catch up and chat! You can reach me via the social sites below.
